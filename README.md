# MemoryViewerTool
**Overview**:

This Python application, Memory Viewer, is designed to display various system metrics like CPU usage, memory utilization, network information, and more through a graphical user interface (GUI). It leverages Python libraries such as `psutil`, `matplotlib`, and `tkinter` to retrieve system data and visualize it.


 **Functionalities included**:
 
- **Display System Information**: Presents detailed system information like OS, CPU, memory, disk, and network details.
- **Show Current Memory Usage**: Shows a pie chart representing the current system memory usage.
- **Show Swapped Memory Usage**: Displays swapped memory details using a pie chart.
- **Plot Historical Memory Usage**: Generates a plot showcasing historical memory usage over time.
- **Show CPU Times**: Shows a pie chart depicting CPU times (user, system, idle, nice).
- **Show Network Information**: Presents network-related metrics through a pie chart.
- **Show Process Information**: Gathers and displays process-specific information.
- **Plot Real-Time CPU Usage**: Plots real-time CPU usage over a minute.
- **Plot Real-Time Network Data**: Visualizes real-time network data (received and sent) in separate plots.
- **Plot Historical Disk Usage**: Creates a historical plot showcasing simulated disk usage changes.

 **To execute the application:**

- Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the python file
- This application follows monolithic architecture.
